# Herbert
Herbert is a challenge previously used in Microsoft's Imagine Cup as an online software programming competition.

It will challenge your ability to see patterns and create algorithms to produce these patterns. It can be used both as a teaching tool for programming as well as a challenge for seasoned programmers.

I believe you'll enjoy challenging yourself with Herbert, whether you are new to programming, new to Herbert, or a seasoned Herbert competitor from the past.

Happy coding!
