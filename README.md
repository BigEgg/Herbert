# Herbert

**Herbert** is an exciting puzzle game.

It previously used in Microsoft's [Imagine Cup](https://www.imaginecup.com/) Algorithm Competitions in 2007-2009.

It will challenge your ability to see patterns and create algorithms to produce these patterns. It can be used both as a teaching tool for programming as well as a challenge for seasoned programmers.

## How Herbert Operate

Herbert use a simple programming language of its own, which called H language. It supports 3 basic actions: Move(s), Turn Left(l) and Turn Right(r).

For many people, programming might sound like very complicated, but for anyone who actually play with it, will find Herbert is easy to learn.

In addition, after play with Herbert, will have a good understanding about many basic programing knowledges, such as: functions, recursion (iteration).

## Levels

Herbert levels can from a very simple problem to very difficult problems. With a variety of degree of difficulty, all kinds of people can enjoy with these Problems

## Finally

I believe you'll enjoy challenging yourself with Herbert, whether you are new to programming, new to Herbert, or a seasoned Herbert competitor from the past.

**Happy coding!**
